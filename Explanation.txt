Front-End development:

Front end development is mostly focused on what some may coin the "client side" of development. 
Front end developers will be engaged in analyzing code, design, and debugging applications along with ensuring a seamless user 
experience. You manage what people first see in their browser. As a front end developer you are responsible for the look, feel 
and ultimately design of the site.

Back-End Development:

Back end Development refers to the server side of development where you are primarily focused on how the site works. 
Making updates and changes in addition to monitoring functionality of the site will be your primary responsibility. This type 
of web development usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Code written by back end 
developers is what communicates the database information to the browser. Anything you canâ€™t see easily with the eye such as 
databases and servers is the work of a back end developer.  Back end developer positions are often called programmers or web 
developers.
